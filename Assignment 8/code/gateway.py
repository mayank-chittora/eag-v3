"""Bridge to llm_gatewayV8.

V8 adds three things: (1) every `/v1/chat` accepts an optional `agent: str`
tag the gateway logs and uses for cost-by-agent rollups and provider
pinning; (2) a `/v1/chat/batch` endpoint that runs N chat requests
concurrently with bounded parallelism; (3) one retry on 5xx / timeout
with `retries` surfaced in the response.

Auto-starts the gateway on port 8108 if it is not already up, then
re-exports the V8 `LLM` client and a module-level `embed()` helper.
